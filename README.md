## Abstract

Prioritizing tasks is essential to realizing the impact that we want to make in the world. The goal that this tool aims to achieve is not to help the user accomplish the most tasks or even all of his tasks. The goal is to help the user feel confident that they are always working on the highest priority task. In the long run, consistently working on the highest priority task will allow real impact to happen.

There are a few major problems that this tool seeks to address:

1. Prioritization
2. Not Working
3. Cognitive Overload
4. Guilt
5. Long Term Optimization (BETA)

### Prioritization

Without proper prioritization, we default to working on urgent tasks or easy tasks as the brain takes the path of least resistance. Therefore, a tool should take on the majority of the work to present a sorted list based on parameters collected from the user (impact, urgency, etc) and calculate a priority based on configurable linear weights that normalize these parameters.

### Not Working

The space of tasks that we shouldn't work on is infinite because we only have a finite amount of time. Therefore, it is important to know which tasks we should not be working on at all. This is partly solved by prioritization because those tasks tend to fall near the bottom. However, this tool also needs to help the user understand more deeply which tasks they should not be working on and perhaps filter before those tasks even make it onto the user's list.

### Cognitive Overload

Another main problem of task lists is the feeling that there are always more tasks than can be accomplished. This is incredibly daunting and often times demotivating. Additionally, given a list of options of tasks to work on, the brain will usually default to the simplest one depending on the level of motivation at any given point in time. Therefore, a tool should do its absolute best to conserve the focus of its user while simultaneously ensuring that the user is always working on the highest priority task at all times.

### Guilt

Sometimes one will feel guilty if they don't feel like they've worked enough. This is a problem that can plague overachievers or workaholics. Therefore, this tool should aim to give confidence that once all items are completed, then the user should be able to completely disengage with their tasks. As such, the tool should work as hard as possible to allow the user to achieve inbox zero.

### Long Term Optimization (BETA)

In order to continue experiencing new challenges as well as scale oneself within a larger organization, we need to ensure that we're not always doing the same tasks in the same way for a long time. Therefore, it's important to automate those tasks which can be automated and delegate the ones which cannot. Therefore, this tool should assist in helping the user identify tasks which fall into these 2 categories and give him a means to prioritize these actions.
